👋 Hi there! I’m Nacho -/ @itabo /-.

I'm a passionate 💞️ software developer with a deep dive into full-stack development, particularly skilled in Node.js for robust backend services, Angular for dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces, and Flutter for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies that enhance project outcomes. My journey through the realms of Node, Angular, and Flutter has equipped me with a versatile skill set to tackle diverse projects, from intricate web applications to seamless mobile apps.

🌱 Collaboration is at the heart of innovation, and I'm keen 👀 on joining forces with anyone who needs an extra pair of hands and a creative mind to bring their projects to life. 
Whether you're looking for technical expertise, brainstorming sessions, or just someone to code alongside, I'm in.

Let's connect and create something amazing together! 🚀
